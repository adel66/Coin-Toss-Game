# Coin Toss Game
Coin Toss OOP based game.

This is an OOP and CPP based (+GUI, not console) game That is builded using most of the oop concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism and more ...
This game was a task (Tutorial) assigned to the 1st Year stundents at the ENSIA in the 2023/2024 season.
It simulates a coin tossing game where the player starts with a balance of zero (0) Dinars,and in each round,he tosses 3 coins at a time, a 10 Dinars,20 Dinars and 50 Dinars at the same time ,And The goal is to reach exactly 100 Dinars balance, if achieved than the player wins, otherwise he is considered as a loser (in the game of course).

I used The wxWidgets library to build the graphical user interface .
